        <p>
          Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards 
          of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action 
          in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, 
          offensive, or harmful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or 
          reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other 
          contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will 
          communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
        </p>

        <h2 id="coc_scope">Scope</h2>

          that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. 
        </p>
        <p>
          All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security
